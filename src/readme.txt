Enhances Downloadable products by enabling ebook watermarking using the LemonInk service.

== Description ==

[LemonInk](https://lemonink.co) is a cloud service used to secure digital books from piracy. It applies a digital watermark to each purchased ebook making it unique and traceable.

Using this plugin, you can easily integrate LemonInk into your WooCommerce store just by marking products as downloadable and assigning a master file (the original ebook) to them.

After each purchase LemonInk will create watermarked versions of your ebooks and attach them to user's order allowing them to easily download their individual copies.

Note that you need to have an account at [LemonInk](https://lemonink.co), but you can easily set it up just by [registering](https://lemonink.co/register). In order to watermark files you'll also need to purchase some credits, but if you just wish to give it a try, there's a test mode available.
